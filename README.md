# Hotel_booking
 Hotel-booking app based on react,The app is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach.
 Here I create json server that file pasted in Hotel_booking repositories and I host json server locally in our system to store all user dynamic data like userDetails(name,email,no.room,type of room etc) and also used for creating Api url of various hotels we just store the hotels related data in json for listing the Hotels. 
 Firstly go to json_Api1 directory in Cmd.Then we need to start json server using json-server --watch data.json --port 1234 command line 
Running the project go to project directory.
run npm to install packages (just a first time).
run npm start(it runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 automatically to view in the browser)
